A [reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) mode for the TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92, etc. series of calculators. For use in the [UIL Calculator Applications](https://www.uiltexas.org/academics/stem/calculator-applications) contest, as RPN/postfix notation is known to be a faster, simpler, and more accurate input method for calculators compared to standard/infix notation.

Includes a second mode, where the user can load and populate pre-defined formulas that commonly appear in the numerical problems on the exam.

Made with [TIGCC](http://tigcc.ticalc.org/).

TODO add more documentation, improve code quality, clean up code and filesystem, add more functionality e.g. solvers, matrices, calculus.
